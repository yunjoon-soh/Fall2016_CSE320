# Explanation of test/
This folder includes all the testing shell scripts for most functions but not necessary every.

USAGE:
	./test_*.sh

* Running scripts MUST BE DONE INSIDE test/ FOLDER.
* Results are pretty self explanatory but not perfect.
* Reading the shell script makes it more comprehensive about the test case.
* All the intermediate files are deleted at the end of shell script except for test\_total.sh. (It creates the acutal mapreduce binary using the Makefile)
